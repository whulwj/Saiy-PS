        your emotional state, you need to speak for at least thirteen seconds. After that, I\'ll\n
        detect when you\'ve finished speaking. You could tell me about your day today, or about a\n
        memory from your past. If you can\'t think of anything, just close your eyes and count slowly\n
        up to fifteen, whilst your mind wanders. I\'ll let you know with a notification when the\n
        analysis is complete.</string>

However, it can take a long time to initialize on some devices, under low memory conditions, so a fresh reboot of your device may solve the issue in the short term. Alternatively, try uninstalling and reinstalling the engine and any associated language packs you have installed. If it continues to fail, you may need to switch to a lower quality, unsupported voice engine, such a Pico TTS</string>
