    <string name="bug_content_delay_speech" translatable="true">Text to speech engines take up a lot of resource
        and consequently can take a while to initialize and be ready to speak. This is more common on higher
        quality engines, regardless of whether they are downloaded and installed on the device or not.\n\nIn the
        Superuser Settings, under Memory Usage, you can adjust how long the text to speech engine is bound to
        Saiy and kept in the memory. The longer allowed time, the less likely the initialization process
        will be required for subsequent commands\n\nThis additional memory usage
        should be negligible to the performance of any modern device. If Android needs the memory back,
        it will take it!\n\nIn the Saiy Settings, if you have selected to use the network synthesized voices
        (available via Google\'s text to speech engine), a delay can occur due to the speed of your network
        connection. If your mobile connectivity is a little hit and miss, disabling this feature unless you are
        connected to WiFi, could certainly helpâ€¦\n\nTap for settings. Tap and hold for Superuser Settings</string>

        detect when you've finished speaking. You could tell me about your day today, or about a
        memory from your past. If you can't think of anything, just close your eyes and count slowly
        up to fifteen, whilst your mind wanders. I'll let you know with a notification when the
        analysis is complete."</string>
