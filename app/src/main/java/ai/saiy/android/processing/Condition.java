/**
 * Class of constants to identify how Saiy should process the voice data. This isn't always to
 * resolve a command, as the application could be in conversation mode or expecting the user to
 * acknowledge interaction from a previous command.
 * <p/>
 * The danger with constants such as these, would be the failure to reset/remove the Condition under
 * weird and wonderful circumstances. This could potentially leave the application stuck sending the voice
 * data to the wrong part of the application. Great care is needed to make sure this doesn't happen.
